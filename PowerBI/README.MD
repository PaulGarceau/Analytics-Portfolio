Power BI Projects

**Superstore KPI**

In this project we will compare year over years sales segmented by item segment and also by region. We will also view a breakdown of overall sales by both item segment and region.

  - Text fields required conversion during ETL. Order and Shipped fields converted from text -> number -> date. Sales, Discount and Profit fields converted from text -> decimal and Quantity field converted from text -> integer.

  - Comparison of year over year sales totals and share by segment and region.
